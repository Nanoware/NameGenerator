## Name Generator

A module that creates names for different entities using a Markov chain model.
It is based on [David Legare's NameGenerator](https://github.com/excaliburHisSheath/NameGenerator), which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
The code has been adopted to the use in Terasology.

The original idea was published by [Oh, The Huge Manatee!](http://ohthehugemanatee.net/2009/10/the-magical-word-o-matic-or-markov-text-analysis-for-fun-and-non-profit/).
This website also contains an excellent explanation of the functionality of the algorithm.
